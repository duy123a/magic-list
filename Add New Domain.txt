When cloning Github/Gitlab project from other domain, there is a chance we can't clone it due to SSL Cert, we need to manually add it

1. Get the certificate from the GitLab server (it will generate the crt at the location u type this cmd)

echo -n | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect gitlab.dehasoft.vn:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > gitlab.crt

OR

Go to https://gitlab.dehasoft.vn

Click to the lock icon near the address => Choose Certificate => Export => Get the crt file


2. Add the certificate to Gitâ€™s trusted store:

git config --global http.sslCAInfo "C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/gitlab.crt"

3. Should able to clone

You can check again by

git config --global --get http.sslCAInfo
